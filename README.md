# bankers-algorithm-simulator
This repository contains the HTML code for a simulator of the Banker's algorithm, intended to be used for explanations during operating systems classes.

The operation is as follows:
- Enter the desired number of processes and resources, then click the "Generate Tables" button.
- Once the basic setup is generated, you can manually fill in the tables and calculate the resources needed to complete each process (using the "Calculate Need" button). You can also calculate resource availability (using the "Calculate Available" button).
- After filling in and calculating, you can check whether a safe sequence exists that avoids deadlock by clicking the "Safe Sequence" button.

Additionally:
- If you want to clear the tables, click the "Reset" button.
- If you want an example of the Banker's algorithm that leads to a safe state, use the "SAFE Example" button.
- If you want a random example to practice, use the "Random Fill" button.
